NTUCSIE Data Structures and Algorithms

In this course, we learned data structueres like BST, redâ€“black tree, heap, treap, stacks, queue, graph, etc.

Also some related algorithms, such as radix sort, bucket sort, KMP, Rabin-Karp, DFS, etc.

We implement these data structures in C.

In the last assignment, we implemented segment tree with lazy tag. It was a challenging data structure, it took us several nights to finish.

The master branch is my work, while FC new branch is the work of my father (he also found the course interesting).

Some of the project we have Nick's work, who is one of my classmates.
